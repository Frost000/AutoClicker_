# AutoClicker

This Windows based AutoClicker will allow you to create inputs to be activated, repeated and stopped remotely with Hotkeys of your choice.
Adjust timing, position and type of input easily thru the Mouse, Keyboard and Macro Tab.
Build, Edit and Save Macro files with the Macro Tab and Manage and trigger them with the Jukebox. 

You will be able to find all the information concerning all the abilities and functions of the app in the help file contained in the Options tab.
